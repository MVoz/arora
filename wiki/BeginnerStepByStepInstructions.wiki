= Step-by-Step Instructions to Run The Latest Arora =

== Introduction ==

Arora is still in early development, which means that there are no compiled installable packages yet. To try the latest code, follow this guide.


== Step 1: Make sure git is installed. ==
To see if git is installed, open up a terminal window and type `git`. If it is not installed, the terminal will report back command not found. If it is installed, you'll receive the git help text. To install git: [http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list Windows], [http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list?can=3 Mac], and for Linux, use your distro's package manager.

_Note: you will also need a compiler chain. Mac users should install the xcode tools, Windows users should install cygwin/mingw, and Linux users should use their distro's manager. Windows users may also need to tweak a few aspects. Use google to figure this out._

== Step 2: Download and install Qt. ==
If you already have qt 4.4 or greater installed, you can skip this step. To install qt 4.4, visit the [http://doc.trolltech.com/installation.html Official Install Instructions].

== Step 3: Download and compile the latest Arora. ==
Now we will download the latest tree of Arora. Issue these commands:
{{{
$ git clone git://github.com/icefox/arora.git
$ cd arora
$ qmake
$ make
}}}
Arora is now compiled. To run arora, simply run `./arora` from the current directory (`(path to original directory)/arora`).

_*Optional*_: To update to the latest Arora in the future, you can issue these commands:
{{{
$ cd (path to original directory)/arora
$ git pull
$ make
}}}
