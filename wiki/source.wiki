Arora requires Qt version 4.4 or newer. Acquire Qt from http://www.trolltech.com/ : [http://doc.trolltech.com/installation.html Official Install Instructions] and [http://trolltech.com/downloads/opensource Download Page]. On Linux check with your distribution for packages.

Simple steps to build Arora:
{{{
git clone git://github.com/icefox/arora.git
cd arora
qmake
make
}}}

Arora requires a build of Qt 4.4, which was released May 6, 2008.


=== Building with QtWebKit Trunk ===
If you want to use Arora with QtWebKit trunk you need to get a copy WebKit trunk as well at Qt 4.4.  Setting the environment variable QT_WEBKIT and rebuilding Arora will cause it to use QtWebKit trunk.  See the file 'src/webkittrunk.pri' in Arora's source for more details and customizations you might need to do to point it to the location of your QtWebKit checkout.

Simple steps to build QtWebKit trunk.

{{{
git clone git://code.staikos.net/webkit 
cd webkit
git checkout -b trunk origin/svn/master  
./WebKitTools/Scripts/build-webkit --qt debug
export QT_WEBKIT=webkit_trunk

edit src/webkittrunk.pri and set the WEBKITHOME location

Now run 'qmake; make clean; make' in Arora
